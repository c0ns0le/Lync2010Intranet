<P>Presence information helps you to contact others and helps others to reach 
you. It provides information about a contact and helps you to decide the best 
way to communicate with that contact. For example, you see that a co-worker’s 
presence indicator is green in your <B class=bterm>Contact</B><B 
class=bterm>s</B> list, indicating that she is Available. You could walk down 
the hall and talk face-to-face, but you notice that her location and note 
indicate that she is working offsite, so you decide to send an instant message 
instead. </P>
<P>A contact’s presence indicator changes color based on several factors, as 
described in the following table, and is accompanied by text that details the 
person’s status.</P>
