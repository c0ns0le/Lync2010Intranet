<P>Microsoft Lync 2010 Attendant takes advantage of the high availability 
features in Microsoft Lync Server 2010 for enhanced client registration, 
discovery, and routing to improve service resiliency and flexibility in design 
and deployment of your Enterprise Voice solution. A well-designed Enterprise 
Voice deployment can help meet your requirements for “always on dial tone.”</P>
<P>The Lync Server 2010 Registrar is a service that tracks clients, 
authenticates users, and provides routing services. The Registrar is not a 
standalone server role but is installed on Standard Edition servers, Front End 
Servers, and Survivable Branch Appliances. </P>
<P>Each user is assigned to a particular Registrar pool, which becomes that 
user’s primary Registrar pool. Each pool has a designated backup registrar pool 
which is used in failure scenarios.</P>
<H4>Central Site Resiliency</H4>
<P>In the case of data center failure, assuming a resilient WAN link between the 
two data centers, users whose primary Registrar pool is no longer available are 
automatically connected to the backup Registrar pool. A client does not need to 
know its primary or backup Registrar pool. The first logon server—typically a 
Director—will always direct the client to either the primary pool or, in the 
event of failover, to the backup pool.</P>
<P>If clients fail over to their backup Registrar pool, the following voice 
features will be available:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
  <LI>Outbound PSTN calls.</LI>
  <LI>Inbound PSTN calls, if the carrier provides the ability to failover to a 
  backup data center.</LI>
  <LI>Enterprise calls both within a site and between sites.</LI>
  <LI>Basic call handling, including call hold, retrieval, and transfer.</LI>
  <LI>Advanced call handling, depending on user’s call-forwarding settings, 
  including call forwarding, simultaneous ringing of endpoints, and call 
  delegation features.</LI>
  <LI>Call Detail Recording (CDR).</LI>
  <LI>Location Information Service for emergency calls.</LI></UL><!--Publish Completed : Thu Mar 24 09:50:26 PDT 2011 (360ms)--></DIV></DIV>
