<P>Microsoft Lync 2010 communications software combines many enhancements to the 
features you know from Microsoft Office Communicator 2007 R2 and Microsoft 
Office Live Meeting 2007. It also adds some exciting new features.</P>

<P>Now all your business communication tools are unified and readily available, 
without having to switch programs. Convenient filters help you:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Look up contacts, in the Contacts list. </LI>
  <LI>Keep up with the latest from your contacts, such as office moves or 
  personal notes, in the Activity Feeds list.</LI>
  <LI>Manage multiple conversations and keep track of recent ones, in the 
  Conversations list.</LI>
  <LI>View your voice mail, and use a dial pad, in the Phone view.</LI></UL>
<P>Lync 2010 integrates the best features of social networking to help get your 
work done in these areas:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Sending and receiving instant messages </LI>
  <LI>Making phone or video calls through your computer </LI>
  <LI>Participating in interactive online meetings</LI></UL>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142790 name=_Toc274142790></A>The “Me Area”</H2>
<P>At the top of the Lync main window is an area where you can always see and 
modify the information about yourself that your contacts will see. Use the “Me 
Area” to:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Show your status</B><B class=bterm>.</B><B class=bterm> 
  </B>Lync keeps track of how available you are, whether in a meeting or call or 
  away from your desk. Your contacts will be able to see your presence status at 
  a glance through the use of red, yellow, and green indicators. There’s also a 
  new status, Off Work, because you have to go home sometime! </LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Type a </B><B class=bterm>personal </B><B 
  class=bterm>note</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Show your contacts at a glance what’s 
  on your mind, whether business-related or just for fun. You can even type a 
  web address that contacts can click to visit.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Customize your personal </B><B class=bterm>picture</B><B 
  class=bterm>.</B> If your organization allows it, you can change your picture 
  from the default photo by choosing one of your own from a website such as the 
  Windows Live network of Internet services.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Specify your location</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Your contacts 
  or emergency services may need to know where you are, for example, in what 
  room, building, or city.</LI></UL>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142791 name=_Toc274142791></A>Contacts enhancements</H2>
<P>You now can see your contacts’ corporate or custom pictures for quick 
identification and change the way you display your contacts, such as by presence 
status or contact group. </P>
<P>Your Frequent Contacts are the 10 contacts you most frequently have Lync 
conversations with (not necessarily the most recent). Lync pre-populates this 
contact group with your team members.&nbsp;</P>
<P>You can “pin” your most important contacts to the top of Frequent Contacts by 
right-clicking the contact’s name and then clicking <B class=ui>Pin to Frequent 
Contacts</B>.</P>
<P>You need only point to a contact to receive rich information about that 
person or distribution group. You can start communicating from the contact card 
as well as from the Contacts list. When you expand the card, the information you 
see includes the contact’s organization.</P>
<P>Also, if you have Microsoft SharePoint services, searching for contacts is 
more comprehensive in Lync than it has been in the past. Because, in addition to 
being able to search for names or phone numbers, you now can search for items 
such as job title, department, or skills and expertise from a SharePoint 
profile. </P>

experience</H2>
<P>Lync includes similar features as the online meeting functionality of 
Microsoft Office Live Meeting 2007, so now you can use a single program for 
instant messages and online meetings.</P>
<P>Meeting organizers now control who gets directly into a meeting and who waits 
in the lobby. Any presenter can admit or decline people who are waiting in the 
lobby.</P>

<P>Collaboration has never been better. Now you can:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Share your desktop or a</B><B class=bterm> </B><B 
  class=bterm>program</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Have a team editing session, or 
  let a group see multiple windows on your desktop.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Show slides</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Add a Microsoft 
  PowerPoint presentation to the meeting, and give or collaborate on a 
  presentation. </LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Write on a whiteboard</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Take notes, 
  or sketch ideas as a group.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Send files</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Make handouts available 
  to participants, or quickly send a document to one person.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Send and receive video</B><B class=bterm>.</B> See 
  participants from around the world at their desks. If you have Microsoft Lync 
  2010 Phone Edition for Polycom CX3000 (the new IP conference phone) or Lync 
  2010 Phone Edition for Polycom CX5000 (which replaces the discontinued 
  Microsoft RoundTable conferencing device), you can see everyone around the 
  remote conference-room table.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Record and play back meetings</B><B class=bterm>.</B> Did 
  someone miss the meeting? That person can see it later, in detail, using the 
  Microsoft Silverlight browser plug-in. You can convert it to the Windows Media 
  Player for easy distribution.</LI></UL>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142794 name=_Toc274142794></A>Improved experience in joining 
meetings</H2>
<P>Now, scheduling a meeting and inviting others is quicker and more 
streamlined. The Meet Now command lets you start an impromptu online meeting, 
with the click of a mouse. Or, you can use Microsoft Outlook to schedule a new 
online meeting, invite others, and join a meeting. You can also join a meeting 
from an instant-messaging (IM) conversation, a notification, your Contacts list, 
or your mobile phone. </P>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142795 name=_Toc274142795></A>Lync 2010 Attendee and Lync Web 
App</H2>
<P>If you have contacts that aren’t in your company, don’t have Lync, or have 
Microsoft Communicator instead of Lync, they can still join your meeting. Just 
send them the standard e-mail meeting request, and they can join using Microsoft 
Lync Web App, in a web browser, or by downloading and installing Microsoft Lync 
2010 Attendee. Lync Web App requires Silverlight and a phone for audio. </P>
<P>When Lync 2010 Attendee is installed, it automatically opens when you join 
meetings hosted on Microsoft Lync Server 2010. Then you can participate with 
everyone else in IM and voice conversations and data sharing, which includes 
desktop and program sharing.</P>
<P><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some meeting capabilities 
might be restricted if you’re joining from Attendee as an anonymous (guest) 
user. For example, you won’t be able to initiate sharing activities unless you 
are a presenter.</P>

VGA and HD video.</P>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142797 name=_Toc274142797></A>Location and emergency services 
</H2>
<P>Lync can note your location and time zone information and share it with 
others. Additionally, location information might also be used for emergency 
services by routing emergency calls to the appropriate emergency response center 
via the transmitted location. </P>
<P><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; The routing service is 
provided by certified solution providers, and service is available only in the 
United States.</P>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142798 name=_Toc274142798></A>Enhanced phone experience</H2>
<P>Lync provides enhanced phone capabilities, with all the functions of a 
traditional phone system, plus useful productivity features.</P>
<P>In the Lync main window, the Conversations list lets you see the calls you’ve 
been in, missed, received, or placed, along with instant messages and meetings. 
The Phone view lists any voice-mail messages you haven’t heard yet, as well as 
an on-screen dial pad for convenient calling. You can even select your favorite 
song or other recorded announcement to play while your callers are on hold.</P>
<P>A new Voice over IP (VoIP) desktop phone is available with Lync Server 2010. 
The phone is designed to replace traditional phone systems (for example, the PBX 
system) in organizations. You can now see the number of missed calls and 
voice-mail messages, as well as place a test call to check the quality of your 
audio.</P>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142799 name=_Toc274142799></A>Delegate enhancements</H2>
<P>If you need other people to occasionally handle your calls, you can set them 
up to do so, and now they don’t need special software. Using Lync, a delegate 
can:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Make and receive calls, and schedule meetings, on behalf of someone </LI>
  <LI>Select a distinctive ring tone for delegated calls, video, and 
  conferences</LI>
  <LI>Share programs </LI></UL>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142800 name=_Toc274142800></A>Privacy relationships</H2>
<P>If you have friends and family in your Contacts list, you probably don’t want 
to share the same kind of information that your workgroup members or other 
colleagues see. Now you can choose which contacts see more or less information 
about you, by assigning them to a different privacy relationship. This is an 
improved version of the access levels available in Office Communicator 2007 
R2.</P>

<H2><A id=_Toc274142801 name=_Toc274142801></A>Interoperability with Office 2010 
and Windows 7</H2>
<P>Limited Lync features are available in Microsoft Office 2003 and Office 2007, 
with many more available when you upgrade to the Office 2010 suite of programs. 
</P>
<P>In Office 2010, you don’t need different lists of contacts anymore, because 
your Outlook and Lync contact lists are unified. See your contacts’ status and 
communicate with them directly from your Office program. Send a contact an 
e-mail message right from Lync.</P>
<P>Lync features are also available from the Windows 7 taskbar.</P>

handling</H2>
<P>Installation and identification of audio devices (such as telephones, 
headsets, and microphones) is easier than ever. Lync supports multiple devices, 
including Universal Serial Bus (USB) devices. Easily switch devices, even when 
you’re in a call.</P>
