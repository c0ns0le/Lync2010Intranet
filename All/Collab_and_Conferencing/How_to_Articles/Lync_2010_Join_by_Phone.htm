or to the audio portion of an online meeting by calling in. You can dial in 
either as a participant or as the conference call leader. Both leaders and 
participants can use dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) to manage the conferencing 
experience. </P>
<P><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Lync 2010 and the Online 
Meeting Add-in for Microsoft Lync 2010, conference call leaders are referred to 
as <B class=ui><B class=bterm>presenters</B></B>. The meeting organizer is 
automatically a leader.</P>
<P>If you are the conference call leader and are calling in without access to a 
computer, you must set your dial-in conferencing PIN number before the call.

<P>You must use your dial-in conferencing PIN if you plan to join as the 
conference call leader. As a conference call participant, you can also use your 
dial-in PIN and work number to be admitted to secure meetings—that is, meetings 
limited to identified participants— without waiting in the lobby. To set or 
change your dial-in PIN, do the following:</P>
<OL class=cntIndent36 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>In the Lync main window, click the <B class=ui>Show Menu</B> arrow<IMG

<P>For most Lync conference calls, joining is as simple as dialing the number 
and recording your name. Once you are connected to the call, you can mute your 
line or hear a list of people on the call by using DTMF commands. DTMF commands 
are touch-tone codes entered on your phone’s keypad. </P>
<H3>Join the conference call as a participant</H3>
<OL class=cntIndent36 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>Open the meeting request, and, under <B class=ui>Join by phone</B>, note 
  the dial-in numbers and conference ID. If you’re travelling, you can also 
  click the <B class=ui>Find a local number link</B> in the invitation to see if 
  dial-in numbers are available for your current location.</LI>

to the call:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
  <LI>The leader has not joined the call</LI>
  <LI>It is a secure call, and you chose, in step 4 above, to wait in the lobby
