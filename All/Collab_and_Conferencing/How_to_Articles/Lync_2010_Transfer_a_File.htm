<p>With Lync 2010, it’s easier than ever to transfer a file to others in an online meeting or conversation. You can drag a file onto a contact name in the Contact list, drag a file onto an existing conversation window, or use the Browse/Open dialog boxes in Windows to navigate to the file that you want to transfer.</p>
<p>This article describes how to transfer a file in peer-to-peer conversations. For information about adding attachments to meetings and group conversations, see “To manage meeting content” at <a href="Lync_2010_Conduct_Meeting_as_Presenter.htm">Conducting a meeting as a presenter</a>.</p><a name="_Toc204662450" id="_Toc204662450"></a><a name="_Toc215398451" id="_Toc215398451"></a><div class="bmkTOChead">What do you want to do?</div>

<p>The easiest way to send a file to a contact is to drag the file and drop it onto the contact name in the Contact list.</p>
<ol class="cntIndent36" type="1" start="1">
  <li>Using your mouse pointer, drag the file that you want to send from a Windows folder location and drop it onto a contact in the Contact List.</li>
  <li>When you drop the file, a file transfer invitation is sent to the recipient. If the recipient accepts the transfer, a <b class="ui">Transfer of &lt;filename&gt; is complete</b> message appears. If the recipient declines the transfer, a <b class="ui">Transfer of file &lt;filename&gt; has been declined by &lt;user&gt;</b> message appears.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are engaged in a conversation with another contact, whether by IM, phone, or audio/video communication, you can send a file to the contact by dragging the file to the conversation window.</p>
<ol class="cntIndent36" type="1" start="1">
  <li>Using your mouse pointer, drag the file that you want to send from a Windows folder location and drop it onto the conversation window.</li>
  <li>When the transfer is complete, a <b class="ui">Transfer of &lt;file name&gt; is complete</b> message appears in the conversation window.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="#top"><img src="../../Images/TopPageIcon_ZA010077668.gif" alt="Top of Page" title="Top of Page" border="0"></a> <a href="#top" class="cntTopOfPage">Top of Page</a></p><a id="_Send_a_file_2" name="_Send_a_file_2"></a><h2><a name="_Send_a_file_2" id="_Send_a_file_2"></a>Send a file to conference participants</h2>
<p>You can send a file to multiple people in a group conversation, meeting, or conference, but you don’t send it in the same way that you do with an individual contact. Since multiple people participate in online conference settings, you add attachments to the conference that other participants can download and view. For information about adding attachments to meetings and group conversations, see “To manage meeting content” at <a href="Lync_2010_Conduct_Meeting_as_Presenter.htm">Conducting a meeting as a presenter</a>.</p>
<p>To send a file to an individual participant, simply open a new conversation window with that particular contact and drag the file onto it.</p>
<p><a href="#top"><img src="../../Images/TopPageIcon_ZA010077668.gif" alt="Top of Page" title="Top of Page" border="0"></a> <a href="#top" class="cntTopOfPage">Top of Page</a></p><a id="_Receive_files" name="_Receive_files"></a><h2><a name="_Receive_files" id="_Receive_files"></a>Receive files</h2>
<p>When someone sends you a file, you receive a file transfer alert on your computer screen, the conversation window opens, and you are prompted to accept, save, or decline the file. To receive a file in a conversation window, do one of the following:</p>
<ul class="cntIndent36" type="disc">
  <li>Click <b class="ui">Accept</b> to receive the file and save it to the default <b class="ui">My Received Files</b> folder location. </li>
  <li>Click <b class="ui">Save As</b> to receive the file and save it a location that is different from the default <b class="ui">My Received Files</b> folder location. </li>
  <li>Click <b class="ui">Decline</b> to refuse the request. The sender receives a message in the conversation window that you cannot receive the file.</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="#top"><img src="../../Images/TopPageIcon_ZA010077668.gif" alt="Top of Page" title="Top of Page" border="0"></a> <a href="#top" class="cntTopOfPage">Top of Page</a></p><a id="_Select_the_folder" name="_Select_the_folder"></a><h2><a name="_Select_the_folder" id="_Select_the_folder"></a>Select the folder for saving received files</h2>
<p>You can change the default folder location where Lync saves your received files.</p>
<ol class="cntIndent36" type="1" start="1">
  <li>In the Lync main window, click the <b class="ui">Options</b> button <img src="../../Images/Lync_Options_Button.png" alt="Lync Options Button" title="Lync Options Button" border="0">, and then click <b class="ui">File Saving</b>.</li>
  <li>In the <b class="ui">File transfer</b> section, next to the <b class="ui">Save to</b> box, click <b class="ui">Browse</b>, and then navigate to the folder where you want to save received files.</li>
</ol>

<p>To open the file(s) that you receive through Lync 2010, do the following:</p>
<ol class="cntIndent36" type="1" start="1">
  <li>In the Lync main window, click <b class="ui">File</b>, and then click <b class="ui">View Received Files</b>.</li>
