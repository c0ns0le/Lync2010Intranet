<P>Group Chat reports your presence status and enables you to see the presence 
status of other people. Presence status, which is the colored circle next to a 
contact’s name, indicates a person’s willingness and availability to 
communicate. Green presence status, for example, indicates that a contact is 
Available for a conversation, whereas red presence status indicates that the 
contact is Busy and might not want to be interrupted. </P>
<P>When you use Group Chat, you might notice that chat room members appear and 
disappear. In addition to presence status, Group Chat also indicates a chat 
room's current participation status. For example, a chat room member only 
appears in the chat room Participant List if the member is signed in to Group 
Chat, and is currently joined to the chat room that you are viewing. The 
presence status of a contact, and the availability of a contact in a chat room, 
determines how and when you start an instant messaging (IM) session with another 
person.</P><A id=_Toc204662450 name=_Toc204662450></A><A id=_Toc215398451

<P>Presence status appears next to users’ names, including yours, in several 
areas in the Group Chat client. You can use presence status to indicate your 
availability to communicate to other people. You can also use presence status to 
determine whether another contact is available for an IM conversation.</P>
<P>Group Chat and other Lync Server 2010 clients, such as Lync 2010, Lync Web 
Access, and Lync 2010 Mobile, are integrated with Lync Server 2010 so that 
presence status is continuously updated based on your activity, or in some 
cases, lack of activity. When you change your presence status in Group Chat, 
your presence status is immediately updated so that other users who are running 
Group Chat see your status change in their Group Chat. The following table 
describes the presence buttons and their corresponding status text.</P>

      <P>The contact is probably not available. This status appears for the 
      following reasons:</P>
      <UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
        <LI>The contact’s computer has been idle for more than the idle time 
        period setting – 15 minutes by default. By default, the transition from 
        Available to Inactive occurs after 5 minutes. Then, after 15 more 
        minutes, the status changes to Away if there is still no activity on the 
        computer.</LI>
        <LI>A contact’s Outlook calendar or Out of Office Assistant tool 
        indicates they are out of the office.</LI>
        <LI>The contact is temporarily unavailable. When activity is detected on 
        the contact’s computer, Lync 2010 automatically resets the presence 
        status to the appropriate state.</LI>
        <LI>The contact has manually set their presence status to be Away or Be 
        Right Back.</LI></UL></TD></TR>

    <TD>Inactive</TD>
    <TD>This contact might be available, but their computer has been idle for 
      more that the idle time period setting – 5 minutes by default. In this 
      state, the contact is online and transitioning from an Available state, as 
      indicated by the half-green/half-yellow button, This status is set by 
      Group Chat.</TD></TR>
  <TR class=trbgodd>
    <TD>Yellow and Red</TD>
    <TD>Busy (Inactive)</TD>
    <TD>This contact is engaged in a meeting or is scheduled to be in a

      been inactive for the idle time period setting – 5 minutes by default. 
      This status is set by Group Chat.</TD></TR>

      <UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
        <LI>The contact has manually set their status to Appear Away. (Appear 
        Offline is not available in Group Chat. Lync 2010 users might be enabled 
        to see Appear Offline though.)</LI>
        <LI>Lync 2010 and Group Chat are not running on the contact’s computer, 
        or the contact has not signed in. The contact has blocked you from 
        seeing their presence status.</LI></UL></TD></TR>
  <TR class=trbgeven>
    <TD>White</TD>
    <TD>Presence unknown</TD>
    <TD>Lync 2010 cannot determine the status of the contact. This status 
      appears because the contact’s presence status is stored on another 
      computer system, such as that of an organization that is not a federated 
      partner.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE></DIV>
<P>You can manually change your presence status to communicate your availability 
to other Group Chat users. For example, if you will be away from your desk for 
several minutes, you can set your presence status to <B class=ui>Be Right 
Back</B>.</P><A id=_Toc276744022 name=_Toc276744022></A>

<P>Each chat room has a Participant List that shows the active members of the 
chat room. Chat room members are considered active if they are signed in to 
Group Chat and they have joined the chat room. Chat room managers appear in the 
Participant List only if they are signed up as members of the chat room, they 
are signed in, and they have joined the chat room. Managers' names appear bolded 
in the Participant List. If a person belongs to a chat room and is signed in to 
Group Chat, the person’s name appears in the Participant List. If the person is 
not signed in to Group Chat, the person’s name does not appear in the 
Participant List.</P>

contact</H2>
<P>Group Chat provides several ways to start an instant messaging conversation 
with a contact. For example, you can click a contact’s name in a chat room 
message area to start an instant messaging session or you can click a contact’s 
name in a chat room Participant List. Before you try to start an instant 
messaging session, check the contact’s presence status to make sure that it is 
Green – Available – before you send a message. Remember, you should only send an 
IM to a contact if the contact’s presence status is Available. If the contact is 
Away, for example, they will receive the instant message that you send but might 
not be present to read it in a timely manner. If the contact is Busy, you should 
probably try again later or interrupt the contact only if the message is 
urgent.</P><A id=_Toc276744025 name=_Toc276744025></A>

<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>In the Participant List, double-click the contact’s name.</LI>
  <LI>If the contact is not available in the Participant List, search for the 
  contact in <B class=ui>My Chat</B>, and then click the name if available. IM 
  contacts are listed in <B class=ui>My Chat</B> chat rooms and filters.</LI>
  <LI>If the contact is not available in <B class=ui>My Chat</B>, click <B 
  class=ui>File</B>, click <B class=ui>Add Contacts</B>, and then type the first 
  name, last name, or e-mail address of the person, and then click the 
  magnifying glass icon. Select one or more users from the Search Results list, 
  and click the <B class=ui>Add</B> button to add them to your My Chat list as 
  Contacts. Click the new Contact’s name in your My Chat list.</LI>
  <LI>To send an instant message without searching for a person, click the <B 
  class=ui>Go</B> menu, and select <B class=ui>Send an Instant Message</B>. When 
  the dialog box appears, enter the recipient's SIP address, and then press 
  &lt;Return&gt;.</LI>
  <LI>In the Message Entry Area, enter the message text, and then click <B 
  class=ui>Send</B>. Contacts who are inactive or away will receive the message 
  immediately but might not read it on their screen until they are actively 
  using their computer again. Contacts who are offline will not receive any 
  messages that are sent to them.</LI></OL>
