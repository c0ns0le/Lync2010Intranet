<P>Microsoft Lync 2010 Group Chat enables you to participate in multi-topic, 
topic-based conversations that persist over time. With Lync 2010 Group Chat 
functionality, organizations can do the following: </P>
<UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Improve communication between geographically dispersed and 
  cross-functional teams.</B> With Group Chat functionality, teams can 
  efficiently share information, ideas, and decisions as a group. The messages 
  posted to group chat rooms (discussion forums) persist so that people from 
  different locations and departments can participate, even when they are not 
  all online at the same time.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Broaden information awareness and participation. </B>Group 
  Chat offers a user interface that helps users create chat rooms to organize 
  themselves into virtual teams. Chat room members can participate in many 
  concurrent discussions, thereby helping to remove communication barriers and 
  improve information distribution across teams and the organization.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Improve communication with your extended enterprise.</B> 
  With the federation capabilities of Group Chat, business partners, customers, 
  and vendors can join chat rooms and participate in secure, shared, group 
  discussions.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Reduce information overload.</B> With Group Chat 
  functionality, you can create a customized list of active discussions (a <B 
  class=ui>My Chat dock</B>) that can be pinned to your desktop. This provides 
  one place for you to see and participate in active conversations. You can also 
  create custom notifications and alerts to manage how you are notified of new 
  messages—through unread message counts in a chat room, pop-up notifications, 
  or even sounds.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Improve information awareness.</B> With filters, you can 
  define conditions, such as keywords in message content, or the value of the <B 
  class=ui>from</B> field in a message, to receive notification when those 
  conditions are met in instant messaging (IM) or chat room messages.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Increase dispersion of important knowledge and 
  information.</B> Documents and links can be included within discussions for 
  access by the entire team. By posting questions to a broader team, users can 
  benefit from responses by subject matter experts. Integration with other 
  information systems enables important organizational data to be easily 
  communicated to large groups.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Help to securely retain organizational knowledge.</B> 
  Search capabilities help you find past discussions so that you can learn the 
  context of important decisions and become familiar with new projects or 
  issues.</LI></UL>

<P>Before you start joining and creating chat rooms, it is useful to explore the 
user interface (UI) of Lync 2010 Group Chat. This helps to understand the 
terminology used when referencing parts of the Group Chat UI.</P>
<P>The Group Chat UI consists of the following four main areas:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=ui>My Chat</B> shows all filters, all contacts, and all the chat 
  rooms that you have joined.</LI>
  <LI>The <B class=ui>Participant List</B> shows the names and presence status 
  of all members currently in the chat room. Names that appear in bold type 
  indicate that the person is a chat room manager. You can right-click a 
  participant to begin an instant messaging conversation, or to get more details 
  on the participant.</LI>
  <LI>The <B class=ui>Message Area</B> shows messages sent to the chat room. For 
  each message, the author, date, and time are included. The message area keeps 
  all previous messages on the screen until the number of messages exceeds the 
  Maximum messages to keep on-screen setting for the chat room. The default is 
  200 messages. If the chat room is enabled for Chat History, messages are 
  stored on the server, and are available through Search.</LI>
  <LI>The <B class=ui>Message Entry Area</B> is where you compose messages and 
  send them to a chat room. As you create messages, you can use the Message 
  Entry Area toolbar to set High Importance status on a message, insert Web 
  links, or links to other chat rooms, attach documents, add emoticons, or 
  insert stories. Stories are basically long messages that you can encapsulate 
  into what is, in Group Chat terminology, a story.</LI></UL>

<P>Before you start to use Group Chat, you have to configure your sign-in 
settings. Group Chat provides two methods for signing in as follows:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Automatic configuration</B>: To use automatic 
  configuration, Lync Server 2010 must be configured for Domain Name System 
  (DNS) SRV record support of automatic client sign-ins. For more information, 
  contact your support team.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Manual configuration</B>: To use manual configuration, you 
  create a new sign-in account before you sign in.</LI></UL><A id=_Toc276737350 
name=_Toc276737350></A>
<H3><A id=_Toc276737350 name=_Toc276737350></A>To sign in using automatic 
configuration</H3>
<OL class=cntIndent36 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>Click <B class=ui>Start</B>, point to <B class=ui>Programs</B>, and then 
  click <B class=ui>Microsoft Lync 2010 Group Chat</B>.</LI>
  <LI>In the Account box of the <B class=ui>Group Chat Sign In</B> window, click 
  <B class=ui>Automatic Configuration</B>. If the support team has configured a 
  sign-in account by using Group Policy objects (GPOs) and set the account so 
  that it is the only account available, that account is listed in the <B 
  class=ui>Account</B> box. In that case, Automatic Configuration is not 
  available and only the specified account appears in the <B 
  class=ui>Account</B> box. Sign in by using the specified account.</LI>
  <LI>Enter your <B class=ui>Sign-in address</B>. This is typically the same as 
  your e-mail address. If you don’t know it, contact the system 
  administrator.</LI>
  <LI>In the <B class=ui>User name</B> field, type your domain and user name. 
  For example: domain\user name.</LI>
  <LI>Enter your <B class=ui>Password</B>. This is typically the same password 
  that you use to sign in to your network account.</LI>

<P>The easiest way to get started with Group Chat is to join an existing chat 
room. One way to join a chat room is to search for it. For example, you may have 
heard from a co-worker about a chat room that could be useful to you. To join, 
use the Group Chat Search feature to find, and then join, the chat room.</P><A

    to display a list of chat rooms in a domain. A domain could be one area of 
    your company, it could be the entire company, or, if your server has been 
    configured to permit federation, it could be another company.</LI>
    <LI>If you know the name of the chat room, type the name in the <B

<P><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; Group Chat members can join 
a chat room. The chat room creator can also send out invitations to participants 
to join the chat room. You will not see "private" chat rooms in search results 
if you do not have permission to view these.</P>
