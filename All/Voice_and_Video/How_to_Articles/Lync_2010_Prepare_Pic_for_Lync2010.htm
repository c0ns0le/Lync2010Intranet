<P>To determine the size of a picture, follow these steps.</P>
<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>Go to the website that has the picture you want to use.</LI>
  <LI>You can determine the size of most pictures by right-clicking the picture, 
  and then clicking <B class=ui>Properties</B>. </LI>
  <LI>If there is no Properties selection when you do Step 2, click <B 
  class=ui>Save Picture As</B>, and then right-click <B class=ui>Properties</B> 
  on the picture that is now saved on your computer.</LI>
  <LI>By default, the maximum allowed size of a picture in Lync 2010 is 30 KB. 
  Depending on the size of your picture, do one of the following:</LI></OL>
<UL class=cntIndent72 type=disc>
  <LI>If the picture is bigger than 30 KB, you’ll need to resize and snip it 
  down to size before proceeding. See the following section about how to reduce 
  the picture size.</LI>
  <LI>If the picture is smaller than or equal to 30 KB, you can go directly to

<P>If you don’t have a personalized picture that is less than 30 KB, you can 
create one as follows:</P>
<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>Go to the website that has the picture that you want to use, and 
  right-click <B class=ui>Save As</B>. Or, open the picture from your hard disk. 
  </LI>
  <LI>The picture must have an acceptable working area, which is approximately 1 
  to 1.5 inches square. To achieve this, right-click the picture, and then click 
  <B class=ui>Open with</B>, select a program (Windows Photo Viewer is good). 
  Drag the corners until you have the required size (that is, 1 to 1.5 inches 
  square for the area you want to use, which is typically only your face). </LI>
  <LI>Now you need to snip out only the area of the picture you want. Click <B 
  class=ui>Start</B>, click <B class=ui>All Programs</B>, click <B 
  class=ui>Accessories</B>, and then click <B class=ui>Snipping Tool</B>.</LI>
  <LI>In the Snipping Tool, click <B class=ui>New</B>, and then click <B 
  class=ui>Rectangular Snip</B>.</LI>
  <LI>Using the Snipping Tool, select the area that you want to include in the 
  picture (typically only your face), click <B class=ui>File</B>, and then click 
  <B class=ui>Save As</B>. Make sure to select JPG as the file type.</LI>
  <LI>Save the file to a location on your computer, such as <B class=ui>My 
  Pictures</B>.</LI>
  <LI>Check the size of the newly saved picture to make sure that it’s less than 
  30 KB. If it is larger than 30 KB, either be sure that your picture on screen 
  is smaller or snip a smaller portion of the picture.</LI></OL>

<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>Go to your existing picture site, and navigate to the folder where the

  <LI>Make sure that the album is publicly available by selecting Everyone, 
  Public, or the equivalent on the site you are using.</LI>
