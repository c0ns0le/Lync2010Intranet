href="Lync_2010_Record_and_Playback_Meetings.htm">Record

<P>All of your saved recordings appear in Recording Manager. From within 
Recording Manager, you can play recordings, rename recordings, or create a video 
format that you can share with others. Accomplish these tasks by using the <B 
class=ui>Lync Recordings</B> tab and the <B class=ui>Windows Media Recordings 
(.wmv)</B> tab in Recording Manager.</P>
<P>To open Recording Manager, click <B class=ui>Start</B>, click <B class=ui>All 
Programs</B>, click <B class=ui>Microsoft Lync</B>, and then click <B 
class=ui>Microsoft Lync Recording Manager</B>.</P>
<H3>Explore the Lync Recordings tab</H3>
<P>Click the <B class=ui>Lync Recordings</B> tab to see Lync 2010 recordings 
saved on your computer. In the <B class=ui>Lync Recordings</B> tab, you can 
play, rename, delete, or browse to Lync recordings. You can also save all or 
parts of the recording in Windows Media format and publish it to others.</P>
<P>When you play a recording from within Recording Manager, the recording opens 
and plays in Microsoft Lync 2010 Recording Player. Lync 2010 Recording Player 
provides a rich viewing experience for the presenter who created the recording. 
You can view the audio, video, instant messaging (IM) conversations, application 
sharing, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, whiteboard, and polling portions of 
the Lync recording just as they were experienced during the Lync meeting or 
conversation. You can also hide any of these features so that you can focus on 
other parts of the Lync recording. With indexing, you can listen to a particular 
speaker or view specific content, and you can also access a list of attendees 
and download attachments. </P>
<P><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; If <B class=ui>Error</B> 
appears in the <B class=ui>Status</B> column for a recording, a problem occurred 
when the recording was originally saved. You can try to recover the recording by 
right-clicking the recording, and then clicking <B class=ui>Retry</B>. Lync 
Recording Manager will attempt to reprocess the recording. If the recording is 
recoverable, the <B class=bterm>Status</B> will change to <B 
class=bterm>Complete</B>. </P>
<H3>Explore the Windows Media Recordings (.wmv) tab</H3>
<P>Click the <B class=ui>Windows Media Recordings (.wmv)</B> tab to display the 
Lync recordings you chose to save in a video format. In the <B class=ui>Windows 
Media Recordings (.wmv)</B> tab, you can play, delete, or browse to a video on 
your computer or another network location. You can easily share a Windows Media 
video file with others. </P>
<P>There are two ways to create a Windows Media version of a recording: you can 
automatically create one when you end a Lync session and save the recording (by 
selecting <B class=ui>Also create a version that you can publish to others</B>), 
or you can create one later from within the <B class=ui>Lync Recordings</B> tab.

a shared network location or a Microsoft SharePoint Server 2010 asset 
library.</P>

  <LI>To change the name of the recording, under <B class=ui>Recording file

  <LI>To change the location of the recording, under <B class=ui>Save to</B>, do

<UL class=cntIndent72 type=disc>
  <LI>In the text box, paste a Web address, such as a SharePoint Server 2010

<P class=cntIndent36><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; If you 
have SharePoint Server 2010 and the appropriate rights, you can save the 
recording to a Microsoft SharePoint asset library. If you have trouble uploading 
the file to SharePoint Server 2010, ask the SharePoint administrator to increase 
both the default maximum upload size (default 50 MB) and the upload timeout 
setting.</P>
<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=6>
  <LI>To select the type of content that you want to include in the published

  <LI>Under <B class=ui>Content in video</B>, select the check boxes next to the 
  type of content you want to include. If a content type is not available, it 
  was not originally included in the Lync session.</LI></OL>
<P class=cntIndent36><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Note&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; If 
certain content in the original Lync session was very large in size (for 
example, a large whiteboard, a long IM session, or dual monitor sharing), the 
content may be less readable in the finished video. Additionally, any ink 
messages in the instant messaging portion of the recording are usually truncated 
because of limited width in the finished video.</P>
<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=8>
  <LI>Under <B class=ui>Time</B>, use <B class=ui>Start Time</B> and <B

  published version to start or end. </LI></OL>
<P class=cntIndent36><B class=cntnote>&nbsp;Tip&nbsp;</B>&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 
Windows Media Recordings tab, you can copy a recording’s full path and filename 
to your clipboard by right-clicking the recording and then clicking <B 
class=ui>Copy Location</B>. You can then paste the path into an email message, 
for example. This feature is especially useful if you saved a Windows Media 
recording on a network share and you want to send the location to other
