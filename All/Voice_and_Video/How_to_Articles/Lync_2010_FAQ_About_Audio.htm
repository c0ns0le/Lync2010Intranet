<P>Audio quality for Microsoft Lync 2010 communications software depends on the 
condition and quality of the network and devices you use. Be sure that your 
audio equipment is connected before you begin using Lync 2010. <A

<P>The Lync setup should detect your phone and any other compatible 
communications devices you are using, such as an IP phone, headset, webcam, 
microphone, and speakers.&nbsp;Also, you can add devices after you install 
Lync.&nbsp; </P>
<P>To ensure that your devices are set up correctly, do either of the following. 
</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>In the Lync main window, click <B class=ui>Show menu</B>, click <B 
  class=ui>Tools</B>, and then click <B class=ui>Audio Device Settings</B>. Or, 
  from the menu bar, click <B class=ui>Tools</B>, and then click <B 
  class=ui>Audio Device Settings</B>.</LI>
  <LI>In the Lync main window, click <B class=ui>Options</B>, and then click <B 
  class=ui>Audio Device</B>. </LI></UL>
<P>Then, click the appropriate drop-down list(s) to configure or adjust your 
speaker, microphone, and ringer as well as volume levels. You can select your 
primary audio device and test the levels of your microphone and speakers.</P>
<P>To switch devices while in a conversation, click the Audio Device menu in the 
Conversation window, and then click the appropriate device in the menu.</P><A

<H2><A id=_Toc274042079 name=_Toc274042079></A>Is my IP phone connected 
correctly?</H2>
<P>When you set up your IP phone, it is important that it is connected 
correctly.</P>
<UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Power Co</B><B class=bterm>r</B><B 
  class=bterm>d</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Make sure that the power cord is plugged 
  into a power outlet, and the other end of the power cord is securely connected 
  to the phone.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Network Cable</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Connect one end of the 
  network cable to the network jack marked LAN, typically on the back of the 
  phone. Connect the other end of the network cable to a network jack on the 
  wall. To avoid audio quality issues, we recommend that you have a direct 
  connection from the phone to your main network jack.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>USB Cable</B><B class=bterm>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>When Lync 
  is installed on your computer, you can simplify the IP phone sign-in process 
  and make and receive calls from your IP phone by using a USB cable to connect 
  your phone to your computer. Make sure that you connect the Type A (larger, 
  rectangular) end of the USB port on your computer, and the Type B (smaller, 
  square) end of the USB cable to the back of the phone.</LI></UL><A

<H2><A id=_Toc274042080 name=_Toc274042080></A>Why am I having audio problems? 
</H2>
<P>If there’s a problem, a notification is displayed in the conversation window 
or the Lync main window. You can click the notification to get more details or 
suggested solutions. </P><A id=_Toc274042081 name=_Toc274042081></A>
<H3><A id=_Toc274042081 name=_Toc274042081></A>Why am I not getting any 
sound?</H3>
<P>If you’re not getting sound through your speakerphone, check that:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent36 type=disc>
  <LI>Your speakers are turned on and that you have not muted sound in your 
  Windows operating system.</LI>
  <LI>Your telephone handset is on the cradle (if you’re getting audio through a 
  phone).</LI>
  <LI>The speaker volume is high enough to be audible.</LI>
  <LI>The device you’re using is selected in the <B class=ui>Audio Device 
  Settings</B> in Lync.</LI></UL><A id=_Toc274042082 name=_Toc274042082></A>
<H3><A id=_Toc274042082 name=_Toc274042082></A>What are some common causes of 
poor device quality?</H3>
<P>Common causes for poor device quality include the following:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Non-optimized devices</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices that are 
  optimized for Lync go through rigorous audio quality testing to ensure that 
  you experience good audio quality. Non-optimized devices may exhibit inferior 
  audio quality caused, for example, by using low-grade audio components.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Third-party</B><B class=bterm> </B><B class=bterm>audio 
  driver or softwar</B><B class=bterm>e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>In some cases, a 
  third-party driver or software may interfere with Lync 2010. </LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Noise</B><B class=bterm>-</B><B class=bterm>cancel</B><B 
  class=bterm>ing device</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is important that a 
  noise-canceling microphone is positioned close to the mouth, approximately 2 
  centimeters or less than 1 inch away from the mouth. This filters out unwanted 
  background noise, so it is important that you position it correctly to avoid 
  audio issues.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Physical damage to the device</B></LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Headset connected to an IP Phon</B><B 
  class=bterm>e&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</B>Most headsets have a button to adjust the 
  volume depending on which audio device the headset is connected to. If you or 
  other callers hear a buzzing noise, make a test call and then adjust the 
  settings on the headset until the buzzing noise is gone.</LI>
  <LI><B class=bterm>Speakerphone</B>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are using the 
  speaker on your phone and callers complain about background noise, make sure 
  that the phone is on a flat surface. Also, make sure that there is no 
  obstruction between the phone and your mouth.</LI></UL>
<P>Lync handles a wide range of devices while still maintaining high quality 
audio and video. However, certain devices might cause echo in the call. To 
reduce echo for a problematic device, Lync triggers a voice switching mode that 
limits the ability for talkers to speak at the same time. </P><A

<H3><A id=_Toc274042083 name=_Toc274042083></A>What can I do to improve device 
audio quality?</H3>
<P>To improve device quality, try the following:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Uninstall any third-party, value-added, audio drivers or software. </LI>
  <LI>Replace any defective or damaged devices. </LI>
  <LI>Use a headset to avoid echo.</LI>
  <LI>If using two separate devices for rendering and capturing audio (such as 
  desktop speakers and webcam), try to place them at an appropriate distance 
  from each other to minimize echo.</LI>
  <LI>If your microphone device supports Microphone Boost, consider adjusting 
  the boost slider bar to a lower level to avoid echoing or clicking 
sounds.</LI></UL><A id=_Toc274042084 name=_Toc274042084></A>
<H2><A id=tips name=tips></A><A id=_Toc274042084 name=_Toc274042084></A>What are 
some tips for avoiding audio issues?</H2>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>We recommend that you do not make calls over a wireless Internet 
  connection, virtual private network (VPN), or remote access service (RAS) 
  connections.</LI>
  <LI>If bandwidth is a problem for you, limit other computer activities while 
  in a call.</LI>
  <LI>Use an IP phone:</LI></UL>
<UL class=cntIndent90 type=disc>
  <LI>If you are doing CPU-intensive work. </LI>
  <LI>If you need uninterrupted phone access. Your USB phone, for example, does 
  not work when your computer is in sleep mode. </LI>
  <LI>If you have enough bandwidth. Using an IP phone may reduce the bandwidth 
  available to other programs and services.</LI></UL><A id=tty name=tty></A>
<H2><A id=_Toc274042085 name=_Toc274042085></A><A id=tty name=tty></A>How does 
TTY work?</H2>
<P>Text telephone (TTY) mode is used for text communication over a telephone 
line. A TTY device must be connected to the computer to interpret the modified 
audio; otherwise you might experience poor audio quality during the call. Using 
TTY mode in a conference call may also cause audio quality issues. </P>
<P>TTY mode is turned off by default. You can turn on TTY mode by clicking <B 
class=ui>Phones</B> in the <B class=ui>Lync - Options</B> dialog box. You will 
then need to sign out of Lync, and then sign back in to use the feature.</P><!--Publish Completed : Wed Apr 27 09:11:37 PDT 2011 (52ms)--></DIV></DIV>
