<P>The recording format in Microsoft Lync 2010 communications software provides 
a rich viewing experience for the presenter who created the recording. From 
within Microsoft Lync 2010 Recording Manager, you can view the audio, video, 
instant messaging (IM) conversations, application sharing, Microsoft PowerPoint 
presentations, whiteboard, and polling portions of the Lync 2010 recording just 
as they were experienced during the Lync 2010 meeting or conversation. You can 
also hide any of these features so that you can focus on other parts of the Lync 
2010 recording. With indexing, you can listen to a particular speaker or view 
specific content, and you can also access a list of attendees and download 
attachments. </P>
<P>Lync 2010 saves recordings in the default location <B 
class=ui>C:\Users\username\Lync Recordings</B>. You can change this location 
from within Lync 2010.</P>
<P>To specify where you want to save recordings:</P>
<OL class=cntIndent54 type=1 start=1>
  <LI>In the Lync main window, click the <B class=ui>Options</B> button (<IMG 
  title="Lync Options Button" border=0 alt="Lync Options Button" 
  src="../../Images/Lync_Options_Button.png"> ), and 
  then click <B class=ui>File Saving</B>.</LI>
  <LI>Under <B class=ui>Lync recordings</B>, click <B class=ui>Browse</B>.</LI>
  <LI>Navigate to the folder where you want recordings to be saved, and then 
  click <B class=ui>OK</B>.</LI></OL>
<P>If you want to make a recording available to others, you can save all or 
parts of the Lync 2010 recording in Windows Media file format. This option 
consolidates all of the recorded content that you want to share into a single 
Windows Media video, which you can publish to others. You can create Windows 
Media version of the recording from within Lync Recording Manager. For details, 
see <A 
href="Lync_2010_Manage_Recordings_in_Lync.htm">Recording 
Manager</A>.</P><!--Publish Completed : Thu Mar 24 09:39:33 PDT 2011 (235ms)--></DIV></DIV>
