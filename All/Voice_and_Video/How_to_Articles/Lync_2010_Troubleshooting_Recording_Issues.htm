currently being recorded, you should check for the conditions described in this

<P>If neither incoming nor outgoing audio is being recorded, this may be due to 
any of the following:</P>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>The audio portion of the conversation or meeting was never started. To 
  start Lync audio, in a Conversation window, click <B class=ui>Call</B>.</LI>
  <LI>Audio was started, but it was inadvertently stopped. To restart Lync 
  audio, in a Conversation window, click <B class=ui>Rejoin</B>. </LI>
  <LI>Audio was started, but it was inadvertently put on hold. To restart Lync 
  2010 audio, in a Conversation window, click <B class=ui>Resume Call</B>. </LI>
  <LI>You connected to audio by using a phone or a device that is not connected 
  through Lync. For example, you may be using a regular telephone to dial into 
  the meeting, or you may have connected to audio by having Lync call you on a 
  regular telephone. In either case, audio cannot be recorded.</LI></UL><A
