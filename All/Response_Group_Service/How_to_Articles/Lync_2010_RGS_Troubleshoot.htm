<P>If you’re having issues with response groups, the following guidelines might 
help you resolve them.</P>
<DIV class=bmkTOChead>In this article</DIV>
<HR class=bmktocrule>

<UL id=bmkTOClist>
  <LI id=bmkTOClinks><A 
  href="#_If_you_are">If 
  you are an agent</A></LI>
  <LI id=bmkTOClinks><A

  you are calling a response group</A></LI></UL>

<H3>Why am I not receiving response group calls?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Unless configured otherwise, response group calls agents only if their 
  presence status is Available or Inactive. Check your presence status.</LI>
  <LI>Privacy mode may be enabled.</LI>
  <LI>If you are in a formal response group where you need to manually sign in 
  to before you can take calls, you might not be signed in to the group. To 
  ensure that you’re signed in, in the Lync main window, click the <B 
  class=ui>Show Menu</B> arrow, point to <B class=ui>Tools</B>, and then click 
  <B class=ui>Response Group Settings</B>.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why can’t I sign in to a formal group through the Agent Groups page?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>There may be a connection issue with the server. Contact your support 
  team.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why don’t I get any call context with the call, or why is the call context 
incomplete?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>If you’re in a Hunt Group, you won’t get any call context. Call context is 
  sent only for Interactive Groups, not for Hunt Groups.</LI></UL>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>If call context is incomplete (missing questions, for example), ask the 
  support team to enter a text version for the incomplete items.</LI>
  <LI>In supervised transfers for anonymous response group agents, call context 
  is transferred only if the transfer is started from the Conversation window 
  with the call context.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why can’t I share my desktop or start a meeting when I’m connected to an 
anonymous response group?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>This capability is not supported for anonymous response groups. You can 
  share desktops only as a member of a standard response group. Have your 
  support team remove the anonymous flag from the workflow.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why can’t I see some of my response groups in the “On Behalf Of” drop-down 
list?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>You can make calls on behalf of your anonymous response groups only. The 
  list of response groups is updated only at sign-in and then every 8 hours 
  thereafter. To refresh the list, try signing out and signing back in.</LI>
  <LI>There may be a connection issue with the server. Contact the support 
  team.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why did I receive a response group call that rang and then suddenly 
stopped?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Another agent answered the call. You will receive a notification that 
  indicates which agent answered the call.</LI></UL>

<H2><A id=_If_you_are_1 name=_If_you_are_1></A>If you’re calling a response 
group</H2>
<H3>Why is the response group marked as available, but nobody answers?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Even if nobody from the group is available to take calls, a response group 
  is always marked as available. Response groups typically have a voice-mail box 
  that accepts the call.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why can’t I find the response group by typing its name in Lync 2010?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>The response group hasn’t been replicated to the address book yet. Type 
  its SIP address instead (sip:sales@contoso.com, for example).</LI></UL>
<H3>Why didn’t the response group take it into account when I pressed a DTMF 
tone?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Dual-tone multifrequency (DTMF) tones are detected only after the welcome 
  message has been played.</LI></UL>
<H3>What can I do if the response group doesn’t properly recognize my voice 
response?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>Speak clearly into the microphone. Be sure there is not too much noise 
  around you.</LI>
  <LI>If the response group misinterpreted your response and moved to the next 
  question, you can’t go back and must start from the beginning.</LI></UL>
<H3>Why can’t I share my desktop or start a meeting when I’m connected to an 
anonymous response group?</H3>
<UL class=cntIndent54 type=disc>
  <LI>This capability is not supported for anonymous response groups. You can 
  share desktops only as a member of a standard response group. Have your 
  support team remove the anonymous flag from the workflow.</LI></UL>
